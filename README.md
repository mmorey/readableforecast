# Readable Forecast

The National Weather Service (NWS) Area Forecast Discussions (AFD) are detailed weather forecasts from 122 NWS offices acros the USA. They offer insights into weather conditions and the factors influencing them. However, their technical language and formatting can make them hard to read, especially on mobile devices.

Readable Forecast simplifys and optimizes AFDs for easy responsive viewing.
