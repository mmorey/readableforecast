# Readable Forecast

Readable Forecast simplifies and optimizes NWS weather reports for easy responsive viewing.

The National Weather Service (NWS) operates more than 100 offices across the USA, each providing detailed, human-generated weather forecasts known as Area Forecast Discussions (AFDs). These AFDs offer invaluable insights into weather conditions and the factors influencing them. However, their technical language and formatting can make them challenging to read, particularly on mobile devices. Take, for example, the official AFD for San Diego. While it is packed with excellent content, the formatting and font choices render it difficult to consume.
